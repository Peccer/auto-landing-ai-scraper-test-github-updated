      "question": "How is this different from traditional scrapers?",

      "question": "Will it work on any website?",
      "answer": "It\u2019s designed for most public, browser-rendered websites. Results can vary based on site complexity and access controls. We provide rate limiting, retries, and responsible scraping controls to improve reliability while respecting site policies."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need to code?",
      "answer": "No. Enter URLs, describe your fields, and click run. For teams that prefer automation, you can use our API, webhooks, and integrations to plug results into your workflows."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you handle anti-bot measures and CAPTCHAs?",
      "answer": "We use full browser automation and smart throttling to mimic human-like behavior. For protected pages or CAPTCHAs, we provide configuration options and best practices. Some sites may require additional permissions or may not be scrapeable."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about accuracy and data quality?",
      "answer": "AI extraction is paired with schema validation, sampling, and deduplication to keep data clean. You can preview results, refine field descriptions, and iterate quickly to reach your target accuracy."
